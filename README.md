Simultaneous2

In development, not at all ready for use.

A state syncronization library for C# built with LiteNetLib and Hyperion.

Each computer has a "Simulation". Each Simulation contains a set of "Entities". Entities contain the game state.

Intended Core Features
- Flexible topography and simulation authority. Could be setup as server authoritative with a client-server architecture, shared authority in a peer-to-peer network, or anything in between.
- Close to single codebase for simulation/gameplay code between server and client.
- Generally easy to use multiplayer system
